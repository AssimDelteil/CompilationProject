Hello, 
This is a project about getting the Abstract Syntax Tree (Arbre de  Syntaxe Abstraite) from code. 

The language is Ada. To see examples of code in ADA, go in the "examples" folder. 

To test the program : go to the "code" folder on your terminal and run the command "make".
After that, if you want, for example, to see the result on TRIVIAL.ADA run the commande :
    "./test_parser ../examples/TRIVIAL.ADA"
All the files on the "examples" were tested.

This project was done in january 2022 by Assim DELTEIL and Simon OMNÃˆS.
